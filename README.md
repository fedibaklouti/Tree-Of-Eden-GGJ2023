### Introduction 
20 Years since the fall of humanity, a lone scientist sends himself to the past to recover humanity's final chance; The Tree of Eden. Tree of Eden is an action-adventure platformer about a lone scientist's journey through time to 400,000 BC to seek the Tree of Eden. Use the Mystical Seeds of Eden to grow your own mushrooms, trees and flowers to ascend across to the very top of the tree. But beware, many adversaries of nature will try to stop you in your path to save humanity.

### How to play:
Also due to time constraints, we couldn't add a tutorial to the game so please read this: 

In the game there are 3 seed types that you can plant: **Mushroom**, **Tree** and **Flower**.
- A Mushroom grows when you plant its seeds and you can use it like a trampoline to get to platforms above you.
- A Tree grows when you plant its seeds and you can use its leaves as supporting platforms to get to platforms above you or avoid enemies
- A Flower grows when you plant its seeds, as soon as you plant it you must jump to get on top of it. It will float upwards for a few moments before disappearing. 

There are 2 types of enemies in this game: **Ground Enemies** and **Airborne Enemies** and both have their own way of taking them down.

- To take down ground enemies you must use your spear, some ground enemies get staggered by your whip attack which makes for an opening for an easy spear attack.
- To take down airborne enemies, you must use your whip.
