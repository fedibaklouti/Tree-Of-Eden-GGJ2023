### Introduction 
20 Years since the fall of humanity, a lone scientist sends himself to the past to recover humanity's final chance; The Tree of Eden. Tree of Eden is an action-adventure platformer about a lone scientist's journey through time to 400,000 BC to seek the Tree of Eden. Use the Mystical Seeds of Eden to grow your own mushrooms, trees and flowers to ascend across to the very top of the tree. But beware, many adversaries of nature will try to stop you in your path to save humanity.
